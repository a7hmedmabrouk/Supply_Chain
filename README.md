# 🛒 Supply Chain Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing a large-scale retail supply chain dataset to extract insights that can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and support strategic decision-making.

## 📊 Project Summary

We worked with a simulated dataset of over **180,000 orders** that includes detailed information about:
- Orders
- Products
- Customers
- Shipping details
- Suppliers

Our goal was to clean, explore, and visualize the data using Python and Power BI to answer key business questions related to sales performance, shipping delays, and market trends.

## 🧹 Key Steps

1. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types  
   - Removed irrelevant columns and standardized formats  
   - Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified sales trends, customer behavior, and market patterns  
   - Analyzed product performance and shipping efficiency  

3. **Visualization with Power BI**  
   - Built a 4-page interactive dashboard (Home, Products, Customers, Shipping)  
   - KPIs include total orders, profit, late deliveries, and more  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Power BI Desktop

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

- **Total Orders:** 181K  
- **Total Sales:** $33.05M  
- **Total Profit:** $3.97M  
- **Late Deliveries:** 99K  
- **Top Products by Sales & Market Segments**
